## Chosen Contracts  
  
 #### Contract #1 - Sound Effect Generation (Diegetic Audio) - Kalvin Malloch  
  
  You are currently been tasked with creating a tool which will generate sound
effects, these should consist of sequences of tone as well as sample manipulations. The sound effect should be clearly tied to an action the player makes in
the game (e.g., picking up an item, attacking, walking over a trap, or so on).
An element of procedurality is expected to vary the tones.

## Instructions

  Open the Unity project called AudioTobyKalvin. When opened, open the folder named Kalvin and locate the Scenes folder. Open the Contract 1 - Kalvin Malloch scene where you can see my contract.
  
#### Contract #4 - User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio) - Toby Atkinson  
  
  You need to develop a tool to generate audio for the user interface. These
should be short tones to feed back to the player that they are successfully
navigating the user interface and configuring the gameâ€™s settings. This should
be somewhat consistent across the interface, but the tones and samples
should be modified in a systematic way to indicate success or failure. A variety
of settings should be made available and configurable by a designer.
